# Bayesian Tool Use Project

## Memory System

Memories are stored in `.claude/memories/` directory, organized by date.

**Directory structure:**
```
.claude/
  memories/
    2026-01-09.md
    2026-01-10.md
    ...
```

**At the start of each session:**
1. Load today's memory file from `.claude/memories/YYYY-MM-DD.md`
2. If continuing previous work, also load recent days' memories as needed
3. Update the memory file throughout the session with important notes

**Memory file contents should include:**
- Session notes and key discussions
- Tasks worked on and their status
- Decisions made and rationale
- Blockers or open questions
- Links to relevant files/code
