% \section{Proof of Corollary 1} \label{app:cor1_proof}

% \begin{proof}
% Let $L_r = \max_\theta \mb E_{\gamma,z} \log q(\gamma| z,\theta, r)$ denote the optimal expected log-likelihood for representation $r$. Note that $H_{CE}(r) = -L_r$.

% From \cref{lem:2}, the mutual information is lower bounded by:
% \begin{align}
%     \mc I(\gamma, Z_r) \geq H(\gamma) + L_r.
% \end{align}

% Taking the difference between code and NL:
% \begin{align}
%     &\mc I(\gamma, Z_{\mathrm{Code}}) - \mc I(\gamma, Z_{\mathrm{NL}}) \nonumber \\
%     &\quad \geq [H(\gamma) + L_C] - [H(\gamma) + L_{NL}] \nonumber \\
%     &\quad = L_C - L_{NL} = H_{CE}(\mathrm{NL}) - H_{CE}(\mathrm{Code}).
% \end{align}

% When $H_{CE}(\mathrm{Code}) < H_{CE}(\mathrm{NL})$, equivalently $L_C > L_{NL}$, the RHS is positive:
% \begin{equation}
%     \mc I(\gamma, Z_{\mathrm{Code}}) > \mc I(\gamma, Z_{\mathrm{NL}}).
% \end{equation}

% Applying \cref{thm:1}:
% \begin{align}
%     P^*_{\mathrm{NL}} - P^*_{\mathrm{Code}} \geq \frac{\mc I(\gamma, Z_{\mathrm{Code}}) - \mc I(\gamma, Z_{\mathrm{NL}})}{\log_2(K-1)} > 0.
% \end{align}

% Therefore, $P^*_{\mathrm{Code}} < P^*_{\mathrm{NL}}$.
% \end{proof}
